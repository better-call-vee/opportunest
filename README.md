  Opportunest is a comprehensive, full-stack Scholarship Management System designed to connect students with global educational opportunities. It features a sophisticated multi-role architecture, enabling distinct dashboard experiences for users, moderators, and admins. From dynamic data visualization to secure, role-based CRUD operations, this project is a showcase of modern MERN stack development principles.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Core Logic

### Multi-Role System & Admin/Moderator Setup

The application's role-based access control is handled securely on the backend. A user's role (`user`, `moderator`, or `admin`) is stored in their MongoDB document.

**To set the initial Admin and Moderator:**
The system is designed for easy setup without needing a complex UI for the very first admin. The roles are assigned based on email addresses defined in the backend's `.env` file.

1.  Add the designated emails to your server's `.env` file:
    ```env
    ADMIN_EMAIL="your_admin_email@example.com"
    MODERATOR_EMAIL="your_moderator_email@example.com"
    ```
2.  When these users register or log in, the `/sync-user` endpoint on the server checks their email against these environment variables and automatically assigns or updates their role in the database.
3.  After this initial setup, the Admin can then promote or demote other users from their "Manage Users" dashboard.

### Data Fetching with Tanstack Query

This project moves beyond basic `useEffect` and `useState` for data fetching. It leverages **Tanstack Query** as the central "server state" manager.

- **Caching:** Fetched data is cached, making navigation between pages feel instantaneous.
- **Automatic Refetching:** Data is automatically refetched when the user re-focuses the window, ensuring the UI is always up-to-date.
- **Invalidation:** When a user performs an action (like deleting a scholarship), the relevant queries are "invalidated," which automatically triggers a refetch of the data and updates the UI seamlessly. This creates a much cleaner and more reliable codebase than manual state management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Opportunest is built with a focus on robust functionality, professional UI/UX, and a secure, scalable architecture.

- **üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Role Architecture:**
  - **User Dashboard:** Allows users to manage their applications, submit reviews for scholarships, and edit or cancel their submissions.
  - **Moderator Dashboard:** Empowers moderators with full CRUD capabilities over scholarships, the ability to manage all user reviews, and tools to provide feedback on applications.
  - **Admin Dashboard:** Provides ultimate control, including all moderator privileges plus user management (deleting users, changing roles), and access to a platform-wide analytics dashboard.

 - **‚öôÔ∏è High-Performance Data Management with Tanstack Query:**
  - All server-side data is managed through Tanstack Query, providing a seamless user experience with features like **caching, automatic refetching, and optimistic updates.**
  - Complex UI, such as the "Manage Users" and "Manage Applications" tables, features dynamic, server-side sorting and filtering that are directly integrated with Tanstack Query's `queryKey` system for maximum efficiency.


- **üé® Eye-Catching & Interactive UI:**
  - **Physics-Based Animations:** The homepage banner features a dynamic background built with **GSAP** and an interactive **Matter.js** dot grid.
  - **3D Carousel:** A stunning, 3D "Coverflow" effect for the image slider, built with **Swiper.js**.
  - **Animated Analytics:** The admin dashboard features beautiful, animated charts built with **Recharts** to visualize platform statistics.
  - **Smooth Transitions:** **Framer Motion** is used throughout the application for page transitions, modal pop-ups, and scroll-triggered animations, creating a fluid user experience.

- **üåó Persistent Light/Dark Mode:**
  - A seamless theme toggle that respects a user's system preference on their first visit and persists their choice in `localStorage`.

## üêû A Note on Debugging & Problem-Solving

A core part of this project was overcoming real-world development challenges. This demonstrates not just the ability to write code, but the critical skill of debugging a complex full-stack application.

> **The Challenge:** The deployed backend experienced intermittent `500 Internal Server Errors`, especially when fetching data immediately after a server restart. The user's role and other data would fail to load.
>
> **The Solution:** I identified this as a classic **race condition**. The Express server was starting to accept requests *before* the MongoDB client had successfully established its connection. The fix was to refactor the `index.js` file to ensure `app.listen()` is only called *after* the `await client.connect()` promise resolves, making the entire application startup process robust and reliable.

> **The Challenge:** The application form's image upload worked locally but consistently failed on the live server with a CORS error, even though the CORS policy was correct.
>
> **The Solution:** I diagnosed this as a security limitation where a third-party API (ImgBB) blocks direct requests from a browser. I engineered a professional solution by creating a backend proxy route (`/upload-image`). The frontend now securely sends the image to our own server, which then uses its secret API key to forward the image to ImgBB, completely solving the CORS issue and protecting the API key.
